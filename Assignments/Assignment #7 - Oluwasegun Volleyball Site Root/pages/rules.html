			<h3>The court dimensions</h3>
			<img src="./../images/rules_court.png" alt="Volleyball court with dimensions" width="700px">
			<p>A volleyball court is 9 m x 18 m, divided into equal square halves by a net with a width of 1 m. The top
				of the net is 2.43 m above the center of the court for men's competition, and 2.24 m for women's
				competition, varied for veterans and junior competitions.</p>
			<p>The minimum height clearance for indoor volleyball courts is 7 m, although a clearance of 8 m is
				recommended.</p>
			<p>A line 3 m from and parallel to the net is considered the "attack line". This "3 meter" line divides the
				court into "back row" and "front row" areas (also back court and front court). These are in turn divided
				into 3 areas each: these are numbered as follows, starting from area "1", which is the position of the
				serving player.</p>
			<p>After a team gains the serve, its members must rotate in a clockwise direction, with the player
				previously in area "2" moving to area "1" and so on, and with the player from area "1" moving to area
				"6". Each player rotates only once after the team gains possession of the service; the next time each
				player rotates will be after the other team wins possession of the ball and loses the point.</p>
			<p>The court is surrounded by an area called the free zone which is a minimum of 3 meters wide and in which
				the players may enter and play within after the service of the ball. All lines denoting the boundaries
				of the court and the attack zone are drawn or painted within the dimensions of the area and are
				therefore a part of the court or zone. If a ball comes in contact with the line, the ball is considered
				to be "in". An antenna is placed on each side of the net perpendicular to the sideline and is a vertical
				extension of the side boundary of the court. A ball passing over the net must pass completely between
				the antennae (or their theoretical extensions to the ceiling) without contacting them.</p>

			<h3>The ball</h3>
			<img src="./../images/rules_ball.jpg" alt="A hand holding a volleyball" width="700px">
			<p>FIVB regulations state that the ball must be spherical, made of leather or synthetic leather, have a
				circumference of 65-67 cm, a weight of 260-280 g and an interior air pressure of 4.26 to 4.61 psi.</p>

			<h3>Gameplay</h3>
			<img src="./../images/rules_gameplay.jpg" alt="Volleyball on a beach in sunset" width="700px">
			<p>Each team consists of six players. To get play started, a team is chosen to serve by coin toss. A player
				from the serving team throws the ball into the air and attempts to hit the ball so it passes over the
				net on a course such that it will land in the opposing team's court (the serve). The opposing team must
				use a combination of no more than three contacts with the volleyball to return the ball to the
				opponent's side of the net. These contacts usually consist first of the bump or pass so that the ball's
				trajectory is aimed towards the player designated as the setter; second of the set (usually an over-hand
				pass using wrists to push finger-tips at the ball) by the setter so that the ball's trajectory is aimed
				towards a spot where one of the players designated as an attacker can hit it, and third by the attacker
				who spikes (jumping, raising one arm above the head and hitting the ball so it will move quickly down to
				the ground on the opponent's court) to return the ball over the net. The team with possession of the
				ball that is trying to attack the ball as described is said to be on offence.</p>
			<p>The team on defence attempts to prevent the attacker from directing the ball into their court: players at
				the net jump and reach above the top (and if possible, across the plane) of the net to block the
				attacked ball. If the ball is hit around, above, or through the block, the defensive players arranged in
				the rest of the court attempt to control the ball with a dig (usually a fore-arm pass of a hard-driven
				ball). After a successful dig, the team transitions to offence.</p>
			<p>The game continues in this manner, rallying back and forth until the ball touches the court within the
				boundaries or until an error is made. The most frequent errors that are made are either to fail to
				return the ball over the net within the allowed three touches, or to cause the ball to land outside the
				court. A ball is "in" if any part of it touches the inside of a team's court or a sideline or end-line,
				and a strong spike may compress the ball enough when it lands that A ball which at first appears to be
				going out may actually be in. Players may travel well outside the court to play a ball that has gone
				over a sideline or end-line in the air.</p>
			<p>Other common errors include a player touching the ball twice in succession, a player "catching" the ball,
				a player touching the net while attempting to play the ball, or a player penetrating under the net into
				the opponent's court. There are a large number of other errors specified in the rules, although most of
				them are infrequent occurrences. These errors include back-row or libero players spiking the ball or
				blocking (back-row players may spike the ball if they jump from behind the attack line), players not
				being in the correct position when the ball is served, attacking the serve in the frontcourt and above
				the height of the net, using another player as a source of support to reach the ball, stepping over the
				back boundary line when serving, taking more than 8 seconds to serve, or playing the ball when it is
				above the opponent's court.</p>

			<h3>Scoring</h3>
			<img src="./../images/rules_score_card.jpg" alt="A volleyball score card" width="700px">
			<p>A point is scored when the ball contacts the floor within the court boundaries or when an error is made:
				when the ball strikes one team's side of the court, the other team gains a point; and when an error is
				made, the team that did not make the error is awarded a point, in either case paying no regard to
				whether they served the ball or not. If any part of the ball hits the line, the ball is counted as in
				the court. The team that won the point serves for the next point. If the team that won the point served
				in the previous point, the same player serves again. If the team that won the point did not serve the
				previous point, the players of the team acquiring the serve rotate their position on the court in a
				clockwise manner. The game continues, with the first team to score 25 points by a two-point margin
				awarded the set. Matches are best-of-five sets.</p>
